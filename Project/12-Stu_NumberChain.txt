# Number Chain

Chain up the numbers


## Instructions


* Using a while loop, ask the user "How many numbers?", then print out a chain of ascending numbers, starting at 0.


* After the results have printed ask the user if they would like to continue.

  
* If "y", restart the process, starting at 0 again.

  
* If "n", exit the chain.



## Bonus

* Rather than just displaying numbers constantly starting at 0, have the numbers begin at the end of the previous chain.

continueNumbers = ""
startingNum = 0
numofNum = 0

while continueNumbers == 'y'
  numOfNum = input("How many numbers?: ")
    for i = 0 to numOfNum
       print(i)
       i = i+1
    end for
    startingNum = startingNum + i
   continueNumbers = input(Would you like to continue?  enter y or n: ")
note:  variable that captures last number, and use that as the starting number next round.  add numOfNum to the print()?
note:  find while and for syntax
